For more information about the options,\nsee RFC 2132 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2132.txt].\n\n *   domain-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four domain name servers, or\n   AmazonProvidedDNS. The default DHCP option set specifies AmazonProvidedDNS.\n   If specifying more than one domain name server, specify the IP addresses in a\n   single parameter, separated by commas. ITo have your instance to receive a\n   custom DNS hostname as specified in domain-name, you must set \n   domain-name-servers to a custom DNS server.\n   \n   \n *   domain-name - If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in us-east-1, specify \n   ec2.internal. If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in another region, specify \n   region.compute.internal (for example, ap-northeast-1.compute.internal).\n   Otherwise, specify a domain name (for example, MyCompany.com). This value is\n   used to complete unqualified DNS hostnames. Important: Some Linux operating\n   systems accept multiple domain names separated by spaces. However, Windows\n   and other Linux operating systems treat the value as a single domain, which\n   results in unexpected behavior. If your DHCP options set is associated with a\n   VPC that has instances with multiple operating systems, specify only one\n   domain name.\n   \n   \n *   ntp-servers - The IP addresses of up to four Network Time Protocol (NTP)\n   servers.\n   \n   \n *   netbios-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four NetBIOS name servers.\n   \n   \n *   netbios-node-type - The NetBIOS node type (1, 2, 4, or 8). We recommend that\n   you specify 2 (broadcast and multicast are not currently supported). For more\n   information about these node types, see RFC 2132\n   [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2132.txt].\n   \n   \n\nYour VPC automatically starts out with a set of DHCP options that includes only\na DNS server that we provide (AmazonProvidedDNS).

If the volume's underlying host\nexperiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there\ncould be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this\noccurs.

The possible values are ok, \nimpaired , warning, or insufficient-data. If all checks pass, the overall status\nof the volume is ok. If the check fails, the overall status is impaired.

This means that your volume has\nbeen affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations\ndisabled, and may have inconsistent data.\n\n Actions: Reflect the actions you may have to take in response to an event. For\nexample, if the status of the volume is impaired and the volume event shows \npotential-data-inconsistency, then the action shows enable-volume-io. This means\nthat you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the \nEnableVolumeIO action and then check the volume for data consistency.\n\nVolume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the\nvolume state.
